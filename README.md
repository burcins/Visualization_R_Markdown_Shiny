# Visualization_R_Markdown_Shiny

In this project, I worked on visualization only with data cleaning at the begining part. I mostly worked with ggplot2 but, I also tried shiny package to create interactive/dynamic graph. However, it only supported by R and R-markdown with attaching shiny package, otherwise it appeared as a static plot.
